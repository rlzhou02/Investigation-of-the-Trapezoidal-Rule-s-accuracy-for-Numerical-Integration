# Investigation of the Trapezoidal Rule's accuracy for Numerical Integration 

This paper is my Math Internal Assessment (Math IA) for International Baccalaureate Diploma Program (IBDP).

In this paper, I

* Identified and proved a new relation between trapezoidal rule approximation error and the number of partition intervals that is different from existing error bound formula

* Used the relation to calculate nonelementary integrals to specific significant figures
